lowmem-tools provides alternative implementations of ls and rm which can
gracefully handle directories containing a very large number of files.

Standard GNU/Linux file systems and utilities don't gracefully handle
directories containing thousands or millions of files under certain conditions.
A well written program will try to limit the number of files per directory to
something that is manageable, but not all programs are well written.  When a
program creates too many files in a directory to be manageable, it is sometimes
difficult to clean up the mess since even utilities like ls and rm get bogged
down.

The problem is due to how glibc implements readdir() - it reads the entire
contents of the directory into memory before returning the first result.  With
very large directories, this can take a long time and even exhaust the system's
memory, causing ls or rm to crash and slow the system to a crawl.

The underlying system call used by readdir(), getdents(), does not suffer from
this behavior.  ls-lowmem and rm-lowmem use getdents().
